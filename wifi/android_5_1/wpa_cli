   for AP that doesn`t have encryption

              >add_network      (It will display a network id for you, assume it returns 0)

              >set_network 0 ssid “666”

              >set_network 0 key_mgmt NONE

              >enable_network 0

              >quit

       if normal, we have connectted to the AP “666”, now you need a IP to access internet, for example:

              dhcpcd wlan0

              if everything is ok, it will get an IP & can access internet

 

       for AP that has WEP

              >add_network      (assume returns 1)

              >set_network 1 ssid “666”

              >set_network 1 key_mgmt NONE

              >set_network 1 wep_key0 “your ap passwork”(if usting ASCII, it need double quotation marks, if using hex, then don`t need the double quotation marks)

              >set_network 1 wep_tx_keyidx 0

              >select_network 1  (optional, remember, if you are connecting with another AP, you should select it to disable the another)

              >enable_network 1

              and then ,get an IP to access internet

 

       for AP that has WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK

              >add_network      (assume returns 2)

              >set_network 2 ssid “666”

              >set_network 2 psk “your pre-shared key”

              >select_network 2  (optional, remember, if you are connecting with another AP, you should select it to disable the another)

              >enable_network 2

              there is still some others options to be set, but wpa_supplicant will choose the default for you, the default will include all we need to set

              and then ,get an IP to access internet
