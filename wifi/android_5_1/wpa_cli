1: run wpa_supplicant first

use the following command:

       wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -C/data/system/wpa_supplicant -c/data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf

      (use “ps”to make sure wpa_supplicant is running )

 

2: Run the command line tool wpa_cli to connect wifi

       wpa_cli -p/data/system/wpa_supplicant -iwlan0

       Then , it will let you set network interactively

 

       some common command:

       >scan = to scan the neighboring AP

       >scan_results = show the scan results

       >status = check out the current connection information

       >terminate = terminate wpa_supplicant

       >quit = exit wpa_cli

       >add_network = it will return a network id to you

       >set_network <network id> <variable> <value> = set network variables (shows

list of variables when run without arguments), success will return OK, or will return Fail

       >select_network <network id> = select a network (disable others)

       >disable_network <network id> = disable a network

       >enable_network <network id> = enable a network

 

3: example

 

       for AP that doesn`t have encryption

              >add_network      (It will display a network id for you, assume it returns 0)

              >set_network 0 ssid “666”

              >set_network 0 key_mgmt NONE

              >enable_network 0

              >quit

       if normal, we have connectted to the AP “666”, now you need a IP to access internet, for example:

              dhcpcd wlan0

              if everything is ok, it will get an IP & can access internet

 

       for AP that has WEP

              >add_network      (assume returns 1)

              >set_network 1 ssid “666”

              >set_network 1 key_mgmt NONE

              >set_network 1 wep_key0 “your ap passwork”(if usting ASCII, it need double quotation marks, if using hex, then don`t need the double quotation marks)

              >set_network 1 wep_tx_keyidx 0

              >select_network 1  (optional, remember, if you are connecting with another AP, you should select it to disable the another)

              >enable_network 1

              and then ,get an IP to access internet

 

       for AP that has WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK

              >add_network      (assume returns 2)

              >set_network 2 ssid “666”

              >set_network 2 psk “your pre-shared key”

              >select_network 2  (optional, remember, if you are connecting with another AP, you should select it to disable the another)

              >enable_network 2

              there is still some others options to be set, but wpa_supplicant will choose the default for you, the default will include all we need to set

              and then ,get an IP to access internet
